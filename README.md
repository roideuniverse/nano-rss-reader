#Why this project

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the **Material Design** guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

# Requirements
1. Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
2. Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
3. Separate an interface into surfaces.
4. Effectively use transitions and motion.
5. App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
6. App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.
7. App theme extends from AppCompat.
8. App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the [Material Design specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).
9. App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.
10. App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.
11. App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
